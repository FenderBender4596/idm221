<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>My name is Jacob Bender, and I am a musician from the philadelphia area. I grew up in Lafayette Hill, and went to school at plymouth whitemarsh High School. During my years at PW, I was a student of the Paul Green School Of Rock, which helped me really find my focus on music, specifically in the area of punk and indie rock.</p>
<p>I’m extremely active in making music and doing music related things, such as performance, composition, and songwriting. I’ve been practicing and honing this skill since middle school, and continue to start new projects, as well as work with my band Dottie Rebel, and perform with other bands such as Paper Machines</p>
