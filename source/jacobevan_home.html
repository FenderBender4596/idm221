<h1>What Is Jacob Evan?</h1>
<p>Jacob Evan is a stripped down, and emotionally intense indie rock project; very different in nature from my work with Dottie Rebel. My first EP, recorded with Quartz Collective Studios, has a heavy focus on acoustic instruments, as well as some electronic elements, and some electric guitars for ambiance. However, this may be subject to change for the next EP, as I will be working with a full band on Know Hope Records, a local label run by JD Perry, of the indie rock band Valencia.I hope that you all enjoy this EP as much as I have enjoyed recording it! Iâ€™ve been taking my time for the past year perfecting the instrumentations and lyrics for this EP. This launch website will be the first step in taking my musical journey to the next level, and I hope you all will accompany me alongside as well! Thank you for visiting, and please stay tuned!</p>
